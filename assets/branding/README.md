# FIT Logo Usage Policy

The logo for FIT (Freezing Internet Tool) has been specifically designed to represent the project and its official
builds. This README file outlines the usage policy for the logo and provides guidance on its proper use.

## Attribution

The FIT logo was designed by Andrea Lazzarotto (**@lazza**).

## Logo License

While the project itself is licensed under an open source license, the logo is subject to a separate usage policy. The
artwork is reserved for the official builds and representations of the project. This means that the logo cannot be used
or distributed in a manner that implies an endorsement or official affiliation with the project, except in cases
explicitly authorized by the project maintainers.

## Authorized Usage

The logo can be used in the following instances:

1. Official Project Builds: The logo can be included in the official builds and distributions of FIT as a visual
representation of the software.

2. Project Website and Documentation: The logo may be displayed on the project's official website and in related
documentation to visually identify the project and its official presence.

3. Third-Party Builds: The logo can be used in third-party builds of FIT that utilize the same source code and do not
alter the functioning of the software. These builds must indicate their distinction from the official builds and should
not imply an endorsement or official affiliation with the project.

## Restricted Usage

The logo cannot be used in the following instances without explicit permission from the project maintainers:

1. Modified Builds: The logo should not be used in modified versions of FIT unless explicitly authorized. If changes are
made to the software, a distinct logo or branding should be used to differentiate it from the official builds.

2. Third-Party Websites or Applications: The logo should not be used on third-party websites, applications, or platforms
without explicit permission. Exceptions are granted for reviews, blog posts or other content covering the project, as
long as no affiliation or endorsement is implied.

3. PDF Reports of Modified Builds: The logo cannot be included in PDF reports generated with modified versions of FIT if
the modifications alter the functioning of the software.

## Contact for Permission

If you have a specific use case for the logo that falls outside the authorized usage mentioned above, please contact the
project maintainers [on GitHub](https://github.com/fit-project/fit/issues) to request permission. Include detailed
information about your proposed usage, and we will consider your request accordingly.

## Logo Modifications

Any modifications or alterations to the logo must also be explicitly authorized by the project maintainers. Unauthorized
modifications may lead to confusion or misrepresentation of the project.

## Conclusion

The FIT logo is a distinctive visual representation of the project and its official builds. By adhering to this usage
policy, we can maintain consistency and clarity in the project's branding. If you have any questions or concerns
regarding the usage policy or logo, please reach out to us.
