DESCRIPTION = (
    "FIT - Freezing Internet Tool is an application for forensic acquisition of content such as web pages, "
    "emails, and social media directly from the internet. FIT is a FLOSS tool: an acronym for 'Free/Libre and "
    "Open Source Software.' It is a type of software whose source code is made available to the public and can"
    " be used, modified, and distributed by anyone, according to the terms of a specific free and open"
    " source software license. This means that, compared to proprietary software, FLOSS software offers "
    "greater freedom and flexibility to users, who can customize it to meet their needs, improve it, and "
    "distribute it without restrictions. Additionally, being open to review by other developers, FLOSS "
    "software often benefits from a more transparent and inclusive collaborative development process. "
    "FIT has been developed using the Python programming language, implementing a modular architecture. "
    "FIT can be downloaded from the following link: {}.<br><br>"
    "A forensic browser is software used to analyze and retrieve data from electronic devices such as computers, "
    "smartphones, or tablets during forensic investigations. This software allows access to device usage information "
    "such as activity history, files and documents, text messages, images, and much more, providing evidence that "
    "can be used in a legal case."

T4DESCR = (
    "Digital forensics is the scientific and technological application of forensic principles to the collection, "
    "preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital data in a legal context. This discipline is used to investigate "
    "cybercrimes such as fraud, data theft, or malware dissemination, and to recover and analyze information from "
    "electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. Digital forensics involves the use of specialized "
    "tools to analyze digital data and ensure the validity of evidence in a legal context. The work of digital forensics "
    "professionals is crucial in assisting investigative agencies and courts in identifying and punishing cybercriminals "
    "and ensuring justice."

TITLECC = "Chain of Custody"

CCDESCR = (
    "The chain of custody is an important concept in forensic science that describes the control and documentation of "
    "the movement and handling of evidence during an investigation or legal process. The chain of custody ensures that "
    "the evidence is authentic, unaltered, and uncontaminated, and that its integrity is maintained from the moment of "
    "collection until its use in court. Maintaining a reliable chain of custody is essential to ensure that the evidence "
    "is valid and suitable to support conclusions in a legal context."
)

TITLEH = "Hash"
HDESCR = (
    "The hash of digital evidence is a unique value that represents digital data and is used to verify the integrity "
    "and authenticity of the evidence. A hash is calculated using a one-way cryptographic algorithm that transforms "
    "data into a fixed-length character string. If the original data is modified, the hash also changes, making it "
    "easy to detect any alterations. In a legal context, the hash of digital evidence is often used to verify that "
    "the original data has not been altered during the process of collecting, preserving, and presenting the evidence. "
    "Maintaining a record of the hash of digital evidence helps ensure its integrity and ensures that it is suitable "
    "to support conclusions in a legal case."
